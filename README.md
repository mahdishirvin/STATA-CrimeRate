The effect of shall laws on crime rate


## Introduction
The impact of guns on crime in America has triggered a lot of public debate. Many strongly
believe that state laws enabling citizens to carry concealed handguns has reduced crime.
According to this view, gun control laws take away guns from law-abiding citizens, while
would-be criminals ignore them leaving potential victims defenseless. Following this view,
The National Rifle Association (NRA) and many politicians across the country campaign
for greater freedom to carry guns.
As a result, many states in the United States have passed right-to-carry laws (also known
as a shall-issue law). A Shall-issue law is one that requires that governments issue
concealed carry handgun permits to any applicant who meets the necessary criteria.
These criteria are: the applicant must be an adult, have no significant criminal record,
have no history of mental illness, and successfully complete a course in firearms safety
training (only in certain states). If these criteria are met, the granting authority has no
discretion in the awarding of the licenses, and there is no requirement of the applicant to
demonstrate "good cause".
We are examining and analyzing historical data on crime in the U.S to answer the
question “Do shall-issues law reduce crime or not?” Previous studies suggest that
evidence for the effect of shall-issue laws on total homicides, firearm homicides,
robberies, assaults, and rapes is inconclusive.Some studies find that right-to-carry laws
reduce violent crime,[Lott and Mustard (1997)] others find that the effects are
negligible[e.g., Duggan, 2001; Ayres and Donohue, 2003a, 2003b], and still others find
that such laws increase violent crime.[Rosengart et al. (2005) ] We would like to find out
whether our data would lead to the same conclusion or show that the shall-issue law has
an effect on reducing the crime rate
